                            <h1>Creating the Display</h1>
                            <p>
                                To create an Advancement you need to create your Display first. The display will contain information like Icon, Title, 
                                Description, Frame, Visibility Options, Background Texture and Positioning. So let's create variables for the required
                                options
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First off, lets look at the Icon
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">ItemStack icon = new ItemStack(Material.STONE);</div>
                            <p>
                                As you can see, the Icon is just a regular spigot ItemStack. However you can also parse a Material to the constructor
                                in case you don't need to apply things like Enchantments or SkullOwners
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next up, lets look at the Title and Description. They are of type JSONMessage which takes a BaseComponent as a parameter
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">JSONMessage title = new JSONMessage(new TextComponent("Title"));
JSONMessage description = new JSONMessage(new TextComponent("Description"));</div>
                            <p>
                                If you want to use colors ore other formatting, look at <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/the-chat-component-api/">
                                the Spigot page on the Chat Component API</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next on our list is a fairly straightforward item: the Frame
                                <br>
                                It sets the outline that will be visible in the Advancement Screen and will decide which message will be displayed
                                when you get the Advancement in the Toast Notification and play a Sound if it's a Challenge
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">AdvancementFrame frame = AdvancementFrame.TASK;</div>
                            <p>
                                There are 3 options to choose from: TASK, GOAL and CHALLENGE
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Last but not least we have the Visibility. You can either select from one of the pre-made Visibilities or implement your 
                                own rules
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">AdvancementVisibility visibility = AdvancementVisibility.ALWAYS;</div>
                            <p>
                                There are 4 Visiblities included in the API:<br>
                                ALWAYS: Is always shown<br>
                                PARENT_GRANTED: Only shown, when parent is granted or any child is granted<br>
                                VANILLA: Only shown, when parent of parent is granted or any child is granted<br>
                                HIDDEN: Only shown when granted or any child is granted<br>
                                <br>
                                If you want to implement your own Rules, create a new instance of AdvancementVisibility or extend it<br>
                                Keep in mind that you might need to update visibility in your Managers if your Visibility Rules rely on
                                something else than an Advancement's Granted Status or an Advancement that is in a different tab and/or in a different
                                Manager
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">new AdvancementVisibility() {
    
    @Override
    public boolean isVisible(Player player, Advancement advancement) {
        if(advancement.isGranted(player)) return true;
        Advancement parent = advancement.getParent();

        return parent == null || parent.isGranted(player);
    }
};</div>
                            <p>
                                Now that we have the required parameters ready, let's create the Display
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">ItemStack icon = new ItemStack(Material.STONE);
JSONMessage title = new JSONMessage(new TextComponent("Title"));
JSONMessage description = new JSONMessage(new TextComponent("Description"));
AdvancementFrame frame = AdvancementFrame.TASK;
AdvancementVisibility visibility = AdvancementVisibility.ALWAYS;
AdvancementDisplay display = new AdvancementDisplay(icon, title, description, frame, visibility);</div>
                            <h1>Additional Display Options</h1>
                            <p>
                                First off, we have the Background Texture. It only has a purpose for Root Advancements (Advancements that define
                                an Advancement Tab). The Background Texture is a direct path to the Texture File you want the player to see.
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">display.setBackgroundTexture("textures/block/yellow_concrete.png");</div>
                            <p>
                                Next up, you should also position your Advancement correctly. You can set a position Origin which will be the Advancement
                                your Advancement will be relative to. If you don't specify an Origin, the Root Advancement of the Tab will be used
                                as an Origin. You then set the relative coordinates (float values).
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">display.setPositionOrigin(parent);
display.setX(1);
display.setY(1.5);</div>
                            <h1>Creating the Advancement</h1>
                            <p>
                                Now that we have created our Display, we can move on to creating the Advancement itself. Advancements take a parent, 
                                a name, a display and a list of flags as parameters. You can ommit the parent or set it to null to make the 
                                Advancement create a new tab. You may also ommit the Flags if you don't want to apply any.
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">Advancement rootAdvancement = new Advancement(new NameKey("your_namespace", "advancement_name"), display);</div>
                            <div class="code">Advancement advancement = new Advancement(parentAdvancement, new NameKey("your_namespace", "different_advancement_name"), display);</div>
                            <div class="code">Advancement advancement = new Advancement(parentAdvancement, new NameKey("your_namespace", "another_advancement_name"), display, AdvancementFlag.SHOW_TOAST, AdvancementFlag.DISPLAY_MESSAGE);</div>
                            <p>
                                The Name is a unique identifier for your Advancement. You should only have a couple of different namespaces for your
                                own project to prevent other projects from having the same namespace, so choose something unique.<br><br>
                                The available Advancement Flags include:<br>
                                SHOW_TOAST: Toast will be shown when Advancement is granted<br>
                                DISPLAY_MESSAGE: Message will be displayed when someone gets an Advancement<br>
                                SEND_WITH_HIDDEN_BOOLEAN: The Advancement will be sent with the hidden boolean set to true which makes it possible to
                                create empty tabs when the Root Advancement has the hidden boolean and there are no children<br>
                                TOAST_AND_MESSAGE: Shorthand for combining SHOW_TOAST and DISPLAY_MESSAGE
                            </p>
                            <h1>Additional Advancement Options</h1>
                            <p>
                                Now we have an Advancement that can either be granted or not, but you might want to have Advancements where
                                multiple Criteria needs to be met. Thats why you can set the Criteria you want.<br><br>
                                There are two types of Criteria:<br>
                                - Criteria where a certain number needs to be reached<br>
                                - Criteria where a list of requirements must be met
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lets look at the simpler one first: The Criteria where a certain number needs to be reached:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">advancement.setCriteria(new Criteria(5));</div>
                            <p>
                                As you might have guessed, this makes it so the target Number is 5
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So let's move on to the more complicated one. For this one you have to pass the Constructor a String Array and a
                                nested String Array. The first one lists all the names that you give your requirements. The second one is basically
                                an AND group of OR groups.
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">advacnement.setCriteria(new Criteria(new String[] {"a", "b", "c"}, new String[][] {{"a", "b"}, {"c"}}););</div>
                            <p>
                                The above example has 3 different actions but only two of them need to be completed. The Advancement will be granted
                                if the Player has a and c and it will also be granted if the Player has b and c. Obviously it will also be granted if
                                the Player meets all 3 requirements.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Advancement Rewards</h1>
                            <p>
                                You can also set a Reward to completing your Advancement.
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">advancement.setReward(new AdvancementReward() {
    
    @Override
    public void onGrant(Player player) {
        player.giveExp(1);
    }
});</div>
                        </div>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <div class="title">Advancement Managers</div>

                            <h1>What are Advancement Managers?</h1>
                            <p>
                                A Advancement Manager is a place to group Advancements and Players together. Generally you want to group as many
                                Advancements and players together as you can.<br>
                                However there are practical applications like having one manager per Player or different Managers for different
                                parts of your project.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Creating Advancement Managers</h1>
                            <p>
                                To create one, you just need to create a new instance of the AdvancementManager class. It takes a Name and optionally
                                an array of Players you want to have in the Manager from the start.<br>
                                The Name is used when you make your manager accessible and will also determine the Save Path if you use the Save Methods
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">AdvancementManager manager = new AdvancementManager(new NameKey("your_namespace", "manager_name"));</div>
                            <div class="code">AdvancementManager manager = new AdvancementManager(new NameKey("your_namespace", "manager_name", player1, player2));</div>
                            <p>
                                Instead of seperating the Players by comma, you may also just pass an Array as the second argument.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Managing Players</h1>

                            <p>
                                To add or remove Advancements simply call the respective methods. Advancements can also be added or removed in bulk by
                                passing an Array but always keep in mind that Advancements should always be added after their parent.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you changed your Advancement somehow, you may update it to the Player
                            </p>

                                To Grant or Revoke Advancements you simply need to call the respective methods.

                                The above examples will either grant or revoke the criteria names a and b. These methods will also return a Result, the
                                Grant Method also has an additional Result Option that will tell you whether this operation has completed the
                                Advancement.

                                If the Advancement's Criteria Type is NUMBER, you may also set the criteria progress.
                            </p>

                                The above example will set the number the player has reached so far. This method also returns a Result which can be
                                unchanged, changed, completed or invalid if the Criteria Type does not match.

                                If you only have one server where the Advancements apply this is the normal way to save Advancements as they will be
                                stored within the plugin folder of the Server.<br>
                                The nested directory depends on your Advancement Managers name<br>
                                To save or load Data you have to pass a player and optionally a list of Advancements. If no Advancements are listed, all
                                Advancements in the Manager will be saved/loaded, otherwise only the selected Advancements will be saved/loaded

                                Toast Notifications are Notifications that are displayed in the form of Advancement Toasts and don't require additional
                                setup like Advancements need with their Advancement Manager.

                                To create a new Toast Notification, you just have to create a new instance of the ToastNofication class.<br>
                                It takes an icon, a description and a frame as arguments.
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">ToastNotification notification = new ToastNotification(icon, description, frame);</div>

                                The icon is an ItemStack, the description is a JSONMessage and the Frame is an AdvancementFrame.<br>
                                You then just have to send the notification to the player.

                                There are many reasons to send Packets yourself, i especially recommend it if you have a setup where you don't add
                                advancements after the first add where it is very important that advancements and tabs remain in a specified order.<br>
                                Because you control when packets are sent you have more control over when things update and you are able to prevent
                                unexpected situations.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You just need to create a new instance of the AdvancementsPacket class. It takes 4 arguments: A player, a reset
                                boolean, a list of advancements and a list of NameKeys.<br>
                                If the reset boolean is set to true, the Player's Advancement Screen will be completely wiped before adding the
                                Advancements in the advancement list.<br>
                                The list of NameKeys describes a list of Advancements to remove<br>
                                If you want to update progress, just include the Advancement in the advancement list
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">AdvancementsPacket packet = new AdvancementsPacket(player, false, advancements, removedAdvancements);
packet.send();</div>
                            <p>
                                Keep in mind that these packets will not trigger Toasts if Advancements get completed, for Toasts use Toast Notifications.
                            </p>

                                If you send Advancement Packets yourself, you shouldn't add the Advancements to a Manager, to manage Criteria, use
